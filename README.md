# UnitedStatesOfButtons

A variety of multi-state buttons in C++/Arduino.  Also tracks double-clicks.

Some states are one-shots, meaning that the state will occur for only one update cycle, allowing events to be triggered, things to be reset, etc.
A 7-state button is the most thorough, but lower state buttons are included for simpler applications (see source for full explanation).
